		<description><![CDATA[I can’t let Keir’s comment pass as it stands. Yes, I do dabble in Deleuzian speculation as I watch the carcrash that is Leeds United. But I do so in a thoroughly engaged manner, so the actual text message was “Things only work by &lt;i&gt;fucking up&lt;/i&gt;.” There’s a world of difference...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey what&#039;s going on. How come you&#039;re blogging. Did Leeds&#039; nadir make you think of the website, arf, arf. Seriously though folks, Me and Brian go and watch Leeds United (don&#039;t sit together) and he texts me Deleuzian anaylsis of the match. Last night it was: &quot;Things only work by breaking down (sic)&quot;. Although the best was when we debated the concept of cramped space in reference to the Leeds midfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still you are right, when we worked on re-writing ACM&#039;s I was struck by how well it sets up the direction we&#039;ve been going since which has been more focused on movement dynamics. In reality I think it only seems contiguous in retrospect because we went in some very contigent and unpredicted directions in the meantime.]]></description>
