		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nate. Glad you liked our/your latest offering. And you’re right about the thing-ness. The electronic version of any text is no match for the actual printed product with all its sensuous &lt;i&gt;dinglich&lt;/i&gt; qualities. Mmmm, smell that ink…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyhoo, I’m not an expert on refrains, but I think your comments make sense. The union organiser model you describe has a clear agenda and possibly an outcome that’s only really visible to one party. And it’s not really open to modulation, which means that it’s not (on its own) a refrain, altho’ it could form part of one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I love your bit about the relation between channels and flows. Damn you! I needed something that succinct a couple of days ago. Ah well...]]></description>
