		<description><![CDATA[These notes are great and it actually links up really well to Dave&#039;s obsession with measure (or penis envy as Dr, Freud might put it). One small point to make clear is that we (labour) are the intensive realm of capital. Capital moves in the extensive realm to capture and limit the innovation, the excess, the surplus created by the intensive processes of cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All right, I know I&#039;m teaching Grannies to suck the intensive spatium of the far from equilibrium egg here but it&#039;s an important to keep moving back to production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bigger point is that these are still notes for us. When we present ideas on Sunday we need to show how these concept can recast movement problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, couldn&#039;t resist posting the above image of an apple: seemed to fit nicely with all the stuff about virtual and actual, intensive and extensive etc. If I’ve got it right, there’s a whole field of intensities that define the apple. The preindividual singularities of the apple are actualised into apple-as-food (rather than apple-as-tree, apple-as-compost, apple-as-projectile etc). That’s the whole process of individuation, the passage from the virtual to the actual. OK, maybe the chicken-and-egg is a better example but it’s offensive to vegans...]]></description>
