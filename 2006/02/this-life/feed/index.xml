<p>The Communist Jesus Club</p>
<p>As the twenty-first century unfolds, humanity appears to profoundly get<br />on our nerves. Despite the significant achievements of the past two<br />centuries, Western societies are nevertheless bent upon crippling and<br />bombing their way to enrichment. Increasingly, progress is equated with<br />the blind acceptance of a cold rationalism based solely on the logic of<br />commodity society. Across the world, new forms of prejudice and<br />irrationalism gain credence in the face of this totalizing ideology.</p>
<p>The Communist Jesus Club invites all those who are concerned about these<br />retrograde developments to collaborate in formulating a positive<br />alternative. We seek to reclaim the questioning and creative elements of<br />the Enlightenment, religions ancient and modern, and communism.  We are<br />dedicated to the idea that human beings can make<br />their own history.</p>
<p>The Communist Jesus Club is being initiated by Frank Bruno, Josie and<br />the Pussycats, Shaquile O&#8217;Neill, Bill Oddie, Dylan Thomas, James<br />Council, the IRA, Omad Djalili and Freddie Starr. Our objective over the<br />next few months is to gain agreement on a series of basic human<br />principles, and to draw<br />up a manifesto for our times. Debates will occur in our heads and in the<br />pub.</p>
<p>As a starting point, we offer the following elastic and critical<br />positions:</p>
<p>1. We are committed to the pursuit of the City of Gold.</p>
<p>2. We support experimentation in all its forms &#8211; scientific, social<br />and personal.</p>
<p>3. We support the development of the human potential, individual<br />self-determination, and the human community.</p>
<p>4. We uphold a human-centred perspective.  You might think position 3<br />makes this clear.  So be it.</p>
<p>5. We uphold a universalist orientation to some of the problems facing<br />the world, while not disputing the fact of uneven development.</p>
<p>6. We seek to critically build upon our heritage, to use and abuse all<br />traditions that contain the seeds of human community.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Some even more random comments. All this resonates with numerous other stuff. Negri, for example, in his conversation with Anne Dufourmentelle (published as &lt;i&gt;Negri on Negri&lt;/i&gt;) reflects on his life, his years in prison, inexile and wonders &quot;what is a life?&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A constant theme running through George Jackson&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Soledad Brother&lt;/i&gt; is how can one live with dignity even in the most adverse circumstances? And this means &lt;i&gt;struggle&lt;/i&gt;. Not because struggle is somehow noble or worthy, but because &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to struggle means to accept inhumanity and indignity: the only way to be(come) human in such circumstances is to struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or as Assata Shakur sings on Asian Dub Foundation&#039;s &quot;Committed to Life&quot; (on &lt;i&gt;Community Music&lt;/i&gt;), we&#039;re reluctant warriors, we do it because we&#039;re committed to life:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ll be honest with you:&lt;br/&gt;I hate war in all it&#039;s forms-&lt;br/&gt;Physical, psychological, spiritual... emotional... environmental&lt;br/&gt;I hate war...&lt;br/&gt;And i hate having to struggle - i honestly do&lt;br/&gt;Because i wish i had been into a world where it was&lt;br/&gt;Unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;This context of struggle and being a warrior and being a&lt;br/&gt;Struggler&lt;br/&gt;Has been forced on me by oppression.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise i would be a sculptor, or a gardener,&lt;br/&gt;Carpenter - you know, i would be free to be so much more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guess part of me or a part of who i am, a part of what i do&lt;br/&gt;Is being a warrior - a reluctant warrior, a reluctant struggler&lt;br/&gt;But... i do it because i&#039;m committed to life&lt;br/&gt;We can&#039;t avoid it, we can&#039;t run away from it&lt;br/&gt;Because to do that is to be... cowardice-&lt;br/&gt;To do that is to be subservient... to devils, subservient to&lt;br/&gt;Evil and so that the only way to live on this planet&lt;br/&gt;With any human dignity at the moment is to struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dignity is a class concept! -- John Holloway&#039;s argument in &quot;Dignity&#039;s Revolt&quot; (in &lt;i&gt;Zapatista! Reinventing Revolution in Mexico&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this also relates to &quot;lifestyle&quot; politics, &quot;ethical&quot; consumption, &quot;fair&quot; trade, etc.: drivent by people&#039;s desire to live without fucking over people over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are questions which we&#039;re faced with daily. How do I go to work and yet remain human? How can I bring up my children so that they can become human yet stay out of prison? How do we interact with our friends, lovers, colleagues, neighbours...? How can we live a life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems questions of &quot;morality&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot; always been preserve of liberalism/bourgeois thought. If we&#039;re attempting to reclaim the notion of entrepreneurship, perhaps we need to reclaim ethics too, notion of a collective, communist ethics.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some even more random comments. All this resonates with numerous other stuff. Negri, for example, in his conversation with Anne Dufourmentelle (published as <i>Negri on Negri</i>) reflects on his life, his years in prison, inexile and wonders &#8220;what is a life?&#8221; </p>
<p>A constant theme running through George Jackson&#8217;s <i>Soledad Brother</i> is how can one live with dignity even in the most adverse circumstances? And this means <i>struggle</i>. Not because struggle is somehow noble or worthy, but because <i>not</i> to struggle means to accept inhumanity and indignity: the only way to be(come) human in such circumstances is to struggle.</p>
<p>Or as Assata Shakur sings on Asian Dub Foundation&#8217;s &#8220;Committed to Life&#8221; (on <i>Community Music</i>), we&#8217;re reluctant warriors, we do it because we&#8217;re committed to life:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest with you:<br />I hate war in all it&#8217;s forms-<br />Physical, psychological, spiritual&#8230; emotional&#8230; environmental<br />I hate war&#8230;<br />And i hate having to struggle &#8211; i honestly do<br />Because i wish i had been into a world where it was<br />Unnecessary.<br />This context of struggle and being a warrior and being a<br />Struggler<br />Has been forced on me by oppression.<br />Otherwise i would be a sculptor, or a gardener,<br />Carpenter &#8211; you know, i would be free to be so much more&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess part of me or a part of who i am, a part of what i do<br />Is being a warrior &#8211; a reluctant warrior, a reluctant struggler<br />But&#8230; i do it because i&#8217;m committed to life<br />We can&#8217;t avoid it, we can&#8217;t run away from it<br />Because to do that is to be&#8230; cowardice-<br />To do that is to be subservient&#8230; to devils, subservient to<br />Evil and so that the only way to live on this planet<br />With any human dignity at the moment is to struggle.</p>
<p>Dignity is a class concept! &#8212; John Holloway&#8217;s argument in &#8220;Dignity&#8217;s Revolt&#8221; (in <i>Zapatista! Reinventing Revolution in Mexico</i>).</p>
<p>But this also relates to &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; politics, &#8220;ethical&#8221; consumption, &#8220;fair&#8221; trade, etc.: drivent by people&#8217;s desire to live without fucking over people over.</p>
<p>These are questions which we&#8217;re faced with daily. How do I go to work and yet remain human? How can I bring up my children so that they can become human yet stay out of prison? How do we interact with our friends, lovers, colleagues, neighbours&#8230;? How can we live a life?</p>
