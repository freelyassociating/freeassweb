		<description><![CDATA[hi Brian,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for disobeying Commissar &lt;br/&gt;Milburn&#039;s orders. We&#039;re working on getting you to a safe location to ward of retaliations right now. Details to follow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I agree that things are different now, and clearly there are always new possibilities. But I&#039;m not keen on the idea that one of these new possibilities might be that now our kind of politics makes sense. That implies that they didn&#039;t before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do think it&#039;s more obvious to more people today, but that&#039;s a different level of where the possibility is: that means &quot;it&#039;s easier to see today that this has always been the case&quot;. That makes sense to me. I&#039;d want to add, though, that some people have seen this for a long time (in a certain sense, women who fought the enclosures of their bodies and of the land saw something like this, even if they didn&#039;t use the terms we use). I think that&#039;s important to me because I want to retain a way to dis the Leninists, to say that their politics were the politics of a privileged sector (and are nowadays even worse, the politics of a museum of a previously privileged sector). Or something like that. &lt;br/&gt;take care,&lt;br/&gt;Nate]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a bit like the second cup of tea: never as good as the first... I think you&#039;re right about periodisation, Nate. And yes, it was a bit clumsily expressed in Event Horizon, as if &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; is the time for composition whereas we could only manage opposition before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But having said that, isn&#039;t it true that there are times and places when composition is more possible/attractive precisely because it resonates? I like the idea of a wrinkle in time because explains why we are (wrinkly) punks, Diggers, etc. and expands this vague idea of resonance (wave forms?). Time doesn&#039;t travel in a straight line so that&#039;s how we are able to be one with movements that apparently died hundreds of years ago. I remember arguing with a Left communist who was adamant that communism just wasn&#039;t possible until the 19th century (communism = soviets plus electricity). That&#039;s obviously nonsense: our flight from capital is ongoing and has always been so. But maybe the move to real subsumption has opened up new possibilities (communism = soviets plus broadband): it&#039;s more obvious now that capital depends on our &lt;i&gt;humanity&lt;/i&gt;, not just labour-power, as the Midnight Notes nebula idea suggests. Our &#039;resistance&#039; is about our &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt; rather than &#039;just&#039; wage demands etc.]]></description>
