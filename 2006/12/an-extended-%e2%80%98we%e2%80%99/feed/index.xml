		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely, as the earlier pamphlets talked about - coming down and going back to the routine world isn&#039;t really a return to the same old, things are different because _we_ are different. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like the phase transition thing a lot. What I should have said then was that I think the extended we is an affect of or at a phase transition, where/when there&#039;s a set of new subjectifications occuring, both individually and collectively. I think this means there&#039;s at least three moments in time - before the phase transition, during it (which is the time of the extended we), and after it. The next time a cycle like this occurs it will be different of course, because we are different. Some of the difficulties that can take place in the come down afterward is wanting to preserve the extended we in the exact same way it was experienced, only to stretch it over time. That can&#039;t work, though. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extended we as a motion is like a sound signal. If you take the sound then extend the time it occurs for you stretch it out, slow it down, break it up. That can be productive and new sounds can emerge (a friend and I used to do this on her computer), but the new sounds are precisely not the old sound repeated. That can be painful if people are hung up on preserving the experience just as it was. I think this is also part of some people&#039;s hyperactivism sometimes, trying to repeat events over and over. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can also occur in relationships - one wants to have the falling-in-love-for-the-first-time part last and last and last. That doesn&#039;t really work, and it isn&#039;t really a loss that it doesn&#039;t, just a difference (another phase transition). Desire to repeat that is part of some people&#039;s need to break up and date again after a certain point has reach - &quot;we&#039;re done falling in love so I&#039;ve got to find someone new to be falling in love with.&quot; I remember this also happening sometimes in forming bands - learning and writing songs together was the falling in love part, doing the stuff to get and play gigs etc was the moving in together and talking about whose going to do what parts of the housework.

		<description><![CDATA[OMG, all this science! I&#039;m not quite sure of the word Nate&#039;s searching for either, that process whereby H2O in the form of water becomes H20 in the form of steam, say, is called a &lt;i&gt;phase transition&lt;/i&gt;. And the &#039;point&#039; at which this occurs is called the &lt;i&gt;threshold&lt;/i&gt;. A few other points from the science of all which might be relevant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Sticking with the H2O example, impurities alter the temperature at which water becomes steam (or 100 degrees colder ice). Add salt, say, and it boils at a higher temperature. And as subjects, we&#039;re not pure! Also, other conditions, e.g. pressure, have an effect too. (Sorry, really don&#039;t know what the relevance of this is. Maybe I&#039;m just showing off my A-level physics.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. We tend to focus on those transitions, at 100 degrees C, say, when &#039;water&#039; turns into &#039;steam&#039;. But remember, that H2O at 100 degrees is an extensive quality of the molar aggegrate. Looking at the molecular level, H2O molecules are switching between water and steam states all the time, evaporating and condensing. Boiling is just when lots of molecules evaporate at the same time. The relevance of this: we can &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; change at &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; time. It&#039;s just during moments of excess, when things are at boiling point, it&#039;s more likely that more of us will change and change together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. For H2O, the phase transitions occurs at the same threshold regardless of &#039;direction&#039;: water boils at 100 degrees C, and steam turns back into water at the same temperature as it cools. But some processes are more nonlinear: the threshold can be different depending on the direction of movement. Which is why once we alter our subjectivities, thru&#039; a moment of excess, say, we don&#039;t necessarily change &#039;back&#039;, even when we &#039;return&#039; to a &#039;material reality&#039; which is no different from that we left.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sorry, I wasn&#039;t done yet - I think the extended we is a feeling or an awareness of that increase of heat. I think it occurs at the points of transition between states (in the sense of physical states). There&#039;s a word for this but I can&#039;t remember it. Like when the ice starts to melt but before it&#039;s all melted, or when water starts to boil but before it&#039;s all steam. The expanded we is like awareness of melting/boiling off via collectively generated heat/resonance, along the lines of movements crystalizing around a problem. Once the transition is completed it can be harder to maintain the collective sense, and also when there&#039;s a need to move back a bit - for the steam to condense, for the water to freeze (to return to a safe striated space).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And one way to heat up water (I think) is to send soundwaves through it - sound being just another level of vibration. Resonance is when sounds reinforce each other, amplify the peaks of the soundwaves, instead of cancel each other out (though I think really some stuff always canceled and some stuff gets amplified). To mix the metaphor a bit, it&#039;s like that old thing about soldiers marching in rhythm with each other across a bridge, the vibrations can start to shake the bridge apart. The stuff on speeds and so on, livability and sustainability of our movements, is about the speed of vibration - wanting resonances and wanting the volume/temperature to increase in order to liquify certain solid forms, but not to melt everything (or rather, to try to shape what does and does not get melted, without burning up and out).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s spot on Nate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it relates to the difference between intensity and extensity that we&#039;ve been grappling with. Temperature is what Deleuze would call an intensive quantity in that it is indivisible. Whereas extensive quantities are divisible. So if you have 2 litres of water and divided it you get 2 lots of 1 litre measures of water. Add them back together and you get two litres again. If you have some water at 50% centigrade amd divided it then both parts would still be 50%. Add them together and you don&#039;t get water at 100% centigrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact water at 100% is at an intensive threashold beyond which it gets fliped into a new state of being, with new traits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He also links energy flow with maintaining high intensity situations: &quot;In a nutshell, while equilibrium thermodynamics focusses on what happens once the intensive differences have been cancelled, far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics studies systems that are continuously traversed by a strong flow of energy or matter, a flow which does not allow the differences in intensity to be cancelled, that is, a flow that maintains these differences and keeps them from cancelling themselves out.&quot;]]></description>
