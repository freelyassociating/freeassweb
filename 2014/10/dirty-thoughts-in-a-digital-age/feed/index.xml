Which is why things get flattened into binaries: are you for or against weev? are you for or against Laurie Penny? are you for or against western intervention over ISIS?*


This taxonomic imperative is related to the identitarian drive of post-Fordism. We all get our own shiny pigeonholes to sit in. That&#039;s why nuanced understandings of the ways in which multiple power relations interweave, overlap and undercut are increasingly parsed through the radical liberal calculus of &#039;intersectionality’: &lt;strong&gt;gender&lt;/strong&gt; plus &lt;strong&gt;race&lt;/strong&gt; raised to the power of &lt;strong&gt;academia&lt;/strong&gt; and divided by &lt;strong&gt;class&lt;/strong&gt;.
