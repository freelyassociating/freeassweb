You&#039;re right (of course) about the way that debt mostly keeps us in line, but also has the potential to destabilise (i.e. unfreeze) social relations. It&#039;s a disciplining mechanism (&quot;keep your head down, don&#039;t cause trouble&quot; etc) but one that could flip (&quot;Aw, fuck it!&quot;). There&#039;s an interesting take on it &lt;a href=&quot;http://polaris.moviments.net:8000/crisi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/09/408879&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Indymedia&lt;/a&gt;) which links back to earlier forms of &#039;criminality&#039; – not just the era of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Hanged-Society-Eighteenth-Century/dp/1859845762/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1221734156&amp;sr=1-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;London Hanged&lt;/a&gt; but more recent times of dole survival in the 1980s which was often supplemented by, ahem, other sources of income.
