		<description><![CDATA[Good point on how antagonism has become ever more individualized. (Someone should write an article about that someday). One of the consequences of this is that it leads us to personalise our resentment. I’m sure that wanker of a boss has his human side but in his role he has to adopt the inhuman logic of capital, he has to personify capital and so act inhumanly. Or then again perhaps he’s just a prick. 

Our line should be “hard on bosses and hard on the causes of bosses”. (I was going to say hard on wankers but it doesn’t work).]]></description>
