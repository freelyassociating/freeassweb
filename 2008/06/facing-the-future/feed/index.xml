		<description><![CDATA[hi Brian, 

I like the flashbulb metaphor a lot. (Move into the light, movement is the light?) This also reminds me of the wrinkle in time/tesseract conversation we had a while back, and of some E.P. Thompson bit that I can&#039;t find and can&#039;t fully remember. It was something about how we pick our predecessors, at least that&#039;s what I took from it. We hang on to the Diggers etc because of an interest we have in the present, tied to a future we want and anger at both certain pasts inflicted on us or our predecessors and certain futures stolen from us/our predecessors. I remember seeing a sci-fi movie once about time travel, I think it was called My Science Project, where they talked about how generating light always involves generating heat too. As another mangled metaphor, maybe there&#039;s some tie between the heat of our anger and the light of the flashbulb moment? Philosophy-wise all of this makes me think of Walter Benjamin&#039;s short thing on the philosophy of history, the stuff on class hatred and on now-time, and about Alain Badiou, the stuff about fidelity to past events. 
Ramble, ramble...

Anyways great post. Sorry I&#039;ve been so out of touch for so long.

take care,
Nate]]></description>
