		<description><![CDATA[I remember the thrill of coming across &lt;em&gt;Written in Flames&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Who Owns Leeds&lt;/em&gt;. It was a real buzz to see, in black and white, the names and addresses of the fuckers who dominate our lives. Part of its attraction was the idea that it was saying &quot;OK, you and me, outside, now…&quot; And in a strange way, it was re-asserting a common humanity. &quot;Look, we all bleed, we all feel pain. Why should you be able to hide?&quot; That&#039;s another Mafia link, the idea of two made guys having it out, &lt;em&gt;mano e mano&lt;/em&gt;, while everyone else looks on. Mind you, our version would have ended up more like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL81QClpLaA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;long slow punch-up&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Fast Show&lt;/em&gt;…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeh, good work Dave. The point of the game of capitalism is that only one side is playing at it, for living labour the stakes are life and death.

The Godfather quote is great and very relevant. The attraction of gangster films is precisely that there is no limited liability, your life is on the line. Gangster films are an off shoot of Westerns, where a group are outside the frontier of the polis and are trying to establish the rules of the game, establish some limited liability. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;The Wire&#039;&lt;/a&gt; the whole drug gang/cops as gang assemblage is referred to as the game, with layer upon layer of rules and norms. So even the stickup man Omar, who breaks the rules of the game by robbing drug stash houses observes strict rules such as keeping Sunday as amnesty day where you can safely visit the family. Contemporary capitalism, is actually much more ruthless and normless, quite literally nothing is sacred. The Wire continually hints at this, the dealers choose their game because they know the bigger game has been rigged against them.]]></description>
