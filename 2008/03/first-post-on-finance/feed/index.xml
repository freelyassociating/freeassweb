		<description><![CDATA[Yep, despite all the talk of &#039;crisis&#039; or &#039;meltdown&#039; there&#039;s still an assumption that &#039;we&#039; can work it through. OK, we might have to tighten our belts a little (some more than others), and some of us might get hurled to one side in the shakedown, but in the end normal service will be resumed. The reality is different. Like you say, the growing uncertainty can actually open up futures. If the housing market in the UK goes into crisis and/or inflation rockets, all sorts of ugly questions appear on the table. This is what happened in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentinazo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Argentinazo&lt;/a&gt;, just as it did in the Weimar Republic. Of course, there&#039;s no guarantee that things will take a &#039;progressive&#039; turn – as we try and turn things to our advantage, maximising our freedom and capacity to act, others will be attempting to limit our movements or harness them to new regimes of domination. It reminds me of the final chase scene in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Trousers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Wrong Trousers&lt;/a&gt;, the bit where the track has run out and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0fjTof8P4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gromit is furiously re-laying it&lt;/a&gt; (in front of him) from a box of spares. As quick as the categories are undermined or called into question, they&#039;re reconfigured into the same old same old… Look how fast climate change politics stuff has been dragged back on to the terrain of money/commodities/capitalist social relations: &quot;Buy this rather than that, and our lives can carry on more or less unchanged.&quot; Their &#039;solution&#039; to the crisis depends on the track being re-layed before we all career off it into another world (or worlds). Our solution means finding the exit(s) before they&#039;re blocked again.]]></description>
