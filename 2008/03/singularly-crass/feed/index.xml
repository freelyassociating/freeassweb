		<description><![CDATA[Ha, thats my quote above about what Crass gigs were like back in the day, I&#039;d forgotten all about that discussion. I ended up going along to the Steve Ignorant Feeding the 5000 gig in shepards Bush despite what I wrote, mainly cos I got a free ticket given to me at the last minute, but I&#039;m also quite looking forward to seeing his Last Supper gigs later this year. I still think what I said is true, but at the end of the day Igs is still a mate and there are probably more important things to get angst about!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems a given that anything with an edge or meaning will get recuperated, might as well just admit it. Though as Sadie Plant mentioned, the real issue is whether people can move beyond that and still come up with new and challenging outlets that can counter the world as it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re right about Jeffrey Lewis: definitely the most interesting attempt to recapture something, although it&#039;s not clear what: Crass themselves re-worked hippy (and were really open about it, confusing many of their fans), and removed the nihilism that was at the heart of (some) punk. On the one hand this means there&#039;s nothing new under the sun: it&#039;s all a folding and a re-folding. On the other hand, each folding takes place in a time and space that can never be repeated. Hence singularity.
Christ, I hope Paris can make sense of this...]]></description>

I&#039;m more than happy for you to use my photo on the front cover of any anthology of yours. But why don&#039;t I edit it as well? I&#039;m not just a pretty face!
