		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not quite sure how Fathers for Justice counts as a &#039;rather dubious&#039; campaign. It was possibly the fact that F4J would never have even got a hearing in left/liberal/revolutionary circles, that pushed them down the route they took. 

Perhaps what they do share with right wing proponents of direct action (such as the Countryside Alliance) is the rhetoric that they only take direct action because the state has in some way let them down or betrayed them. 

Put simply, Anarchists take direct action because it is part of our politics, some right wingers take that route only when their politics are not accomodated in the way they always have been.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm... &lt;em&gt;How low can you go?&lt;/em&gt; Not low enough obviously. &lt;em&gt;Riot for austerity?&lt;/em&gt; You really couldn&#039;t make it up. I&#039;ll try to assemble my thoughts about climate camp soon but in the meantime I see that Monbiot has written another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/climatechange.kingsnorthclimatecamp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;storming analysis&lt;/a&gt; which contains the gem that &quot;I don&#039;t know how to solve the problem of capitalism without resorting to totalitarianism&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.libcom.org/forums/news/monbiot-attacks-anarchism-over-climate-change-again-27082008&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; someone has offered £200 to whoever gives dear George a black eye.
