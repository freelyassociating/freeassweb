		<description><![CDATA[Aw come on Brian.... please?  :)

Just did a bit of googling, found this - 

http://www.righthandpointing.com/latin/?p=167
&quot;In casu extremae necessitatis omnia sunt communia.
In the case of extreme necessity, all things are common.&quot;

According to The Idea of Natural Rights by Brian Tierney, Aquinas said it. Other refs to the slogan  on p276 of the Handbook of European History, 1400-1600 by Tracy and Oberman and in ch4 of Kautsky&#039;s Communism in Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation.

Whoo!

cheers,
Nate]]></description>

It will be permanently and prominently engraved or tattooed onâ€¦ each person who gets the mark of the beastâ€¦ The mark of the beast will look attractive and beautiful. It will please the senses and will excite the admiration of those who see it. Most people who wear it will be proud to have it. The mark will be plainly visible for all to see. Your friends and family will be able to see if you have received the mark. Your employer can look at you and see the mark.
