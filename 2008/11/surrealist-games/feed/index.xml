		<description><![CDATA[RE: &quot;Thatâ€™s why Svejkism (also known as work to rule) is such an effective form of workplace sabotage. Svejk comes from a book by a Czech author Hajek called â€˜The Good Soldier Svejkâ€™.&quot;

&quot;Svejkism&quot; is more that work-to-rule: see Tropos Kynikos: Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek&#039;s The Good Soldier Å vejk, by Peter Steiner, in the &quot;Analyses&quot; section of SvejkCentral.com

The name of the author is HaÅ¡ek.

The military is not Czech, but Austrian, as in Austro-Hungarian Empire. :-)

New translation of The Good Soldier Svejk is available at http://zenny.com./ More information about the Svejk phenomenon at http://SvejkCentral.]]>/</description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like that stuff about the interplay between chance and collectivity. And Gaz makes a really useful distinction between experimental and exploratory. I tend to talk about &quot;experimentation&quot; too much, and it has got horrible (although laughable) overtones of men in white coats and rats pulling levers. And that&#039;s a hop, skip and jump away from the scientistic/positivist outlook of Marxism-Leninism...
I&#039;ve just finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Revolutions-Hari-Kunzru/dp/0141020202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226180272&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Revolutions&lt;/a&gt; (which is great, a real page-turner), and there&#039;s a clear sense of how exploration turns into something more didactic, a strategy of &lt;em&gt;revelation&lt;/em&gt;. If there&#039;s one decisive moment, it&#039;s when Uther, the local shaman, drops out of sight: &quot;without him, things got cold. Cold and hard.&quot; Of course, Chris/Mike only realises this in retrospect. At the time, there seems to be an inescapable logic pulling them all in one direction. It&#039;s only later that it&#039;s possible to see how much of this logic is not ours, but capital&#039;s (capital as &lt;em&gt;separation&lt;/em&gt;, capital as &lt;em&gt;discipline&lt;/em&gt; etc). So the question is this: how can we step outside the game long enough to decide whether it&#039;s a game worth playing? Or is it even possible to ask that question without implying some sort of strategic overview?]]></description>
