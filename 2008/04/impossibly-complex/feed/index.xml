		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, Dave&#039;s right… and wrong as well. It&#039;s not just a question of getting the ship &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; the bottle, just as it&#039;s not just about getting it &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the bottle. There&#039;s a relation between the two. Political action is (literally) unthinkable without some sort of simplification. Lines are drawn. Ships go into bottles. But those lines are kicked over or transformed into new shapes, just as butterflies emerge from the bottle. And there&#039;s probably something else here about &lt;em&gt;writing machines&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;capture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;physicality&lt;/em&gt;… but it&#039;s best expressed in this:

		<description><![CDATA[This is great stuff! The images are nice too, but they&#039;re in the wrong order. It&#039;s not a question of getting the ship into the bottle, but rather of getting it out.

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliantly put, especially the point about the BwO being the point of stupidity of any organised body (insert your own joke here). As movements form, they create their own new limits of sense (because existing worlds don&#039;t make sense). Which creates new impossibilities from which we have to strive to escape. So you&#039;re right, we have to orientate movements towards escaping the impossibilities of capital (perhaps by bringing up the C-word); but at the same time we have to also look to the new impossibilities.
And that&#039;s why we need three Weetabix.]]></description>
