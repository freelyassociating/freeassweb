Thanks for sharing. I agree we need to think about what to do between moment of excess&#039; and that struggles and relationships of social reproduction are key. I think key to this is to map, conceptualise, systematise and learn from the experiences and practices of movements and communities around the globe who manage to create the conditions of possibility for the emergence of other subjectivities and relationships of social reproduction and their sustainability. I write about this in relation to the reinvention of left subjectivities in Latin America in this piece (its free access!) http://lap.sagepub.com/content/40/4/5.full.pdf+html]]></description>
