<p>Just a quick note to let y’all know that <span style="font-style: italic">Worlds in Motion</span>, our article for <a href="http://www.turbulence.org.uk/" style="font-style: italic">Turbulence</a>, has finally been approved. All i’s dotted and t’s crossed and it’s <a href="http://www.nadir.org.uk/worldsinmotion.html">here</a>. That’s me with the Engels beard by the way&#8230;<br />
The whole <span style="font-style: italic">Turbulence</span> experience has been a bit, well, turbulent. We wrote the bulk of the article at the back end of last year so it seems a bit stale now, altho it will improve with age, like a fine whine. But one of the tensions that’s become apparent right at the end has been the one between <span style="font-style: italic">identity</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">affinity</span>. I’ve just had a look round the back and seen that Keir’s brewing up a  <a href="http://thefreeassociation.blogspot.com/2007/05/to-affinity-and-beyond.html">blog post</a> on this very subject (“Two sugars, mate! You got any biscuits?”), so I don’t want to steal his thunder. But on the day that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6633493.stm">this</a> happens, it does raise a lot of questions about the whole identity/affinity thing. Strange things can happen very quickly, and sometimes we find ourselves without the tools to deal with new situations. Which can itself be brilliant.<br />
One of the oddest moments at the recent global meeting in Venice was the <a href="http://www.globalproject.info/art-11643.html">session</a> on the Middle East. When Musthapha Barghouti finished speaking, the hall erupted into a massive standing ovation. We were sat at the front and it was <span style="font-style: italic">weird</span> to turn round and see 700 people on their feet applauding &amp; cheering a government minister. It’s the same with Sinn Fein: one minute we all seem to be moving in the same circles, the next their preferred channels of communication are with Labour ministers. Some of this relates to sovereignty and governance. But part is also to do with how identity politics exploded in the mid-1980s. At its worst, there was an unofficial scorecard operating, a hierarchy of oppressions. Where did this come from? From below, from that drive towards autonomy and self-determination. But also from above, as parties struggled to construct a new constituency: the Labour Party with the GLC, the left with <a href="http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/mt/index_frame.htm">Marxism Today</a>. Of course the miners’ strike fucked a lot of this up, as old-fashioned class war returned to the streets. And it also helped draw a line, behind which another constituency could develop: ‘You want identity politics? What about <span style="font-style: italic">class,</span> the biggest identity of all?’ But it’s daft to see one as good, and one as bad. Some of the most productive moments come when identity rubs up against affinity. And that was what was interesting about the Barghouti ovation. Right, I can see you’re getting bored, so we can return to this when Keir’s done his post. Class dismissed.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic">A lot of us running around talking about politics don&#8217;t even know what politics is. Did you ever see something and pull it and you take it as far as you can and it almost outstretches itself and it goes into something else? If you take it so far that it is two things? As a matter of fact, some things if you stretch it so far, it’ll be another thing. Did you ever cook something so long that it turns into something else? Ain’t that right? That’s what we’re talking about with politics.</span></p>
<p>From a 1969 speech by Black Panther Fred Hampton, lifted from <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/">here</a>. It seemed right to move it to a post in its own right, not just because it’s ineffably cool, but also because it’s right about so many things.</p>

<p>Sorry about this, but we’re trying to tidy this blog up so it’s a bit more useful to the random passer-by (we get <span style="font-style: italic">loads</span> of those). In the past we’ve used this space as a way of composing our collective thoughts. And when it works, it works really well. But for the last couple of months we’ve been working on an article which we’ve just submitted to <a href="http://www.turbulence.org.uk/">Turbulence</a> (as soon as it’s finalised we’ll post it <a href="http://www.nadir.org.uk/">here</a>) and this blog has become a little too introspective. So we’re now setting up a private room, round the back, where we can tinker with ideas without imposing on you lot too much.<br />
And then hopefully this space can become a little more productive, a little more interactive, and maybe a tad less <span style="font-style: italic">painful</span>.</p>

<p>Here’s a thought that occurred to me after Sunday’s meeting (Keir will be posting notes from that later). It’s not very well articulated but it might prompt something more coherent&#8230;</p>
<p>At the meeting a few people talked about ‘an extended we’ as one of the signs that we’re winning. What does that mean? I think it’s to do with feeling connected – not emotionally, figuratively or psychologically, but <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> connected – to other people, so that when things were kicking off in Seattle, say, we felt as one with those who were there. Or rather we <span style="font-style: italic">were</span> as one with them – this isn’t a subjective thing.</p>
<p>All this seems airy-fairy (or just plain bollocks) because it’s hard to avoid talking about it in subjective, individualist or idealist terms, even though we’re trying to get away from all those dualisms. Maybe another way into this is to think again about social movements as <span style="font-style: italic">processes</span> not things. It’s counter-intuitive because it means thinking about ourselves not as ourselves (individuals bound up in revolutionary politics) but as a collection of processes. The moments when we’re winning are those when we can see social relations moving. At those times our movement isn’t a movement of <span style="font-style: italic">us</span> (activists vs others) but a <span style="font-style: italic">moving of social relations</span>, an unfreezing of all that is fixed.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a link here to Marx’s idea of the proletariat being the class that abolishes itself as a class (as opposed to those who worship &amp; defend the most fixed and static notions of what class is, as a <span style="font-style: italic">thing</span>). We felt we were winning because we weren’t ‘we’ any more (sorry, this makes a bit more sense if you read it out loud); maybe we’d even abolished any idea of a ‘we’, because there was no outside, no ‘they’ (this relates to a comment made the other night which questioned the whole idea of winning because the way we’d framed it suggested someone else would be losing). This moving of social relations is like the breaking of an ice-floe: it has no edges or boundaries (“this group are in our movement, this group aren’t” etc), or else the boundaries are always in motion; the moving ripples through everywhere – absolutely <span style="font-style: italic">everywhere</span>.</p>
<p>Of course when this happens, the ‘equilibrium’ of everyday life is shattered. Capital likes to present itself as fixed, immutable or natural (it depends on an endless production of novelty, but it is the same old same old). So maybe that’s one of the things about winning: it’s when we (an extended ‘we’) reveal the social relations of capital as partial, temporary.</p>

<p>I’m half-way through a new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bash-Rich-True-Confessions-Anarchist/dp/0954417771/sr=8-1/qid=1164968008/ref=pd_ka_1/026-1065372-9013239?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">book</a> by one of the founders of Class War. It’s pretty un-fucking-putdownable (see, it’s already having an impact on the way I write), mainly cos it captures that whole sense of <span style="font-style: italic">potential</span> that existed in the mid to late 1980s. Some of this might be pure nostalgia, but it was a pretty mad time. And one of the things that was mad about it was the seamless way struggles flitted back and forth without any of the sniping or prejudice that set in later. There didn’t seem to be any outright <span style="font-style: italic">contradiction</span> between any of these struggles – anarcho-punk squatters, anarcha-feminist peace campers, animal rights activists, striking miners, wannabe rioters etc. Sure there was loads of tension, some of it pretty aggressive and intense, but all of it was productive. Resonance produced movement: we seemed to be <span style="font-style: italic">going</span> somewhere (probably related to the fact that we were often literally going somewhere: demos, marches, Stonehenge, Henley…).</p>
<p>OK, one of the simplistic counter-arguments to this is that we were young, and everything seemed possible – it’s that feeling you get as you lie in the grass on a summer’s day and stare up into the sky. A slightly more sophisticated response points to the importance of dole culture. Both points are pretty valid. And there’s also a sense that getting older is, as much as anything, a process of accretion – things stick to you (jobs, homes, families…). We <span style="font-style: italic">slow down</span>.</p>
<p>But I’m trying to fit this in with the stuff we’ve been thinking about recently, especially the relation between the intensive and the extensive. It seems to make sense. Part of the madness about Class War then was that it was immeasurable. Literally. Groups were springing up all over the place calling themselves ‘Xxxx Class War’. And this whirlwind was making the intensive field visible. A bit like throwing flour onto a kitchen surface so you can see where the mice are going. The process is nothing new. It’s exactly the same as punk, or the Paris Commune or blah blah blah. I like to think that the ‘<span style="font-style: italic">Behold Your Future Executioners</span>’ banner had some small print somewhere which read ‘<span style="font-style: italic">Behold the Unruhe</span>’. Compare that to the bureaucratic machine of the Class War Federation with its delegate meetings and conference proposals&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course it’s easy to drift into thinking that intensive=good and extensive=bad, or that it should be a one-way relationship. <span style="font-style: italic">Cold water in the face brings you back to this awful place… </span>But this awful place is where we are. The intensive might be the realm of change but that change happens in the real, which involves the extensive. So Bone’s book has made me think again about ‘stuntism’, as way of trying to direct the movement <span style="font-style: italic">from</span> extensive <span style="font-style: italic">to</span> intensive, i.e. trying to use the normal mechanisms of capture (especially the media) to re-open the field of possibilities. Which was a pretty fucking cute tactic – just so long as you don’t call it a dialectic, OK?</p>
<p>And if you really want to get down-and-dirty philosophical, <a href="http://accursedshare.blogspot.com/2006/07/singularities-and-preindividual-field.html#c115861205062757388">this</a> caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Thesis of Ontological Excess’: Being is more than one and prior to one. The preindividual is in excess of its actual individual expressions. Being is ‘problematic’ (or differential) and individuals are only ever temporary resolutions of these tensions; tensions that continue to subsist even after actualization. This thesis of excess is thus counter to any ontology based on lack.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t claim to understand the finer points of it, does it fit in with relation between extensive and intensive?</p>
<p>I’ll stop here cos I’m rambling (something else to do with age).</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">(Note to self: must use this blog more often)</span></p>
<p>We’ve recently re-worked our piece on <a href="http://www.nadir.org.uk/anticapitalist.html">anti-capitalist movements</a> for inclusion in a book scheduled to come out next year (we’ll post it, along with the book details, once it’s been finally accepted). The original article was written some five years ago, and it was strange coming back to it after such a gap. For one thing, some of it was awfully clunky – reflecting our own lack of confidence, I think, and the fact that we had yet to develop a <span style="font-style: italic">style</span> of our own. But I was surprised how well some of the ideas still stood up, especially the whole movement-as-thing which we’re always banging on about. We’d already gone back to the piece for <a href="http://www.nadir.org.uk/whatisalife.html">What is a life?</a>, so maybe it shouldn’t have come as such a surprise. All the same, I find this sort of ‘consistency’ (continuity?) quite reassuring: we might be barking up the wrong tree, but at least it’s the same damn tree and we haven’t (yet) started chasing cars or howling at the moon…</p>
<p>There’s some link here to that notion of durability which we’ve been mulling over, altho’ I’m not really sure what that link is. How do you stay working together as a group without blood-letting or clinging to some doctrinal purity, and yet still remain open? I don’t think we’ve cracked it, although we’ve had our moments.</p>
<p>Finally I stumbled across <a href="http://blog.voyou.org/2006/09/03/communism-is-not-identity-politics/#more-7">this</a> which has some smart things to say on the ‘identity politics of class’ and the thing-like nature of, well, things… I got really giddy until I saw that <a href="http://whatinthehell.blogsome.com/">Nate</a> had already been there, marking his territory. Arf, arf!</p>

                            		              		<p>I know I risk becoming <span style="font-style: italic">trop français</span> here, but I couldn&#8217;t let this one slip through… Spotted this on the <a href="http://libcom.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8816">libcom</a> forums yesterday, which is proving a great place for first hand reports as much as analysis &amp; debate. Anyway, this comes from someone who&#8217;d just spent five days in Rennes and picks up as they&#8217;re leaving a demo/march/riot:<span class="postbody"></p>
<blockquote><p>As I left with the militants I had come with, yesterday afternoon, we saw a <span style="font-style: italic">manif</span> (=demo) of 1000 <span style="font-style: italic">lycées</span> (=schoolkids) The militants didn&#8217;t have a clue what it was about. It seemed to be heading to the <span style="font-style: italic">centre comerciale</span> (=shopping centre), where a blockade had been organised for the next day. But it was a day early. When people refuse to wait for organised days of action but just begin; when militants don&#8217;t know every demo&#8217;s time and place; when the cry of &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic">vive la commune</span>&#8216; goes up from 2000 on a spontaneous demo in Paris against the propagation of the CPE – we live in interesting times.</p></blockquote>
<p></span></p>
<p>Again, if we see movements as <span style="font-style: italic">things</span>, then we need to know who&#8217;s &#8216;in&#8217; and who&#8217;s &#8216;out&#8217;. But when we see movements as a <span style="font-style: italic">verb</span>, as the <span style="font-style: italic">moving</span> of social relations, then of course they have no boundary, no inside and no outside – which is precisely why they are <span style="font-style: italic">social</span> movements, not discrete lifestyle pockets (hmm, sounds like a fashion tip). And also why social <span style="font-style: italic">centres</span> is something of a misnomer: when things really start to happen, then those centres will be outflanked and outmoded (which is great). And finally, this reminds me of a discussion about Gleneagles/Stirling last week where someone complained that meetings made (at the camp) on the Monday evening &#8220;weren&#8217;t implemented&#8221; (on the roads) on the Wednesday morning – as if it&#8217;s some sort of conference where policy is discussed, ratified and set in stone. I can just see this fellow in Rennes trying to turn back a mob of schoolkids with the anguished cry of &#8220;No, no, no, I thought we had <span style="font-style: italic">consensus</span> on this – this isn&#8217;t planned for today, please go home…&#8221;</p>

                            		              		<p>Good meeting last night at the CommonPlace about recent events in France. Made me return to some nagging questions about identity, definition and movement. One person (old anarcho-type) made a strong intervention denouncing the &#8216;statist trade unions&#8217; and their stewards who&#8217;d pointed out troublemakers to the riot cops. He insisted that the key point now was for the movement to <span style="font-style: italic">define itself</span> in opposition to all those who would &#8216;recuperate&#8217; it or sell it out.</p>
<p>Fair enough, in some ways. But in other ways what&#8217;s been exciting about France has been how the movement has kept exploding outwards, jumping over all definitions imposed on it (from within &amp; without). So while it&#8217;s nominally over a change to labour law, it&#8217;s quickly blowing up into something more general, a questioning of widespread &#8216;precarity&#8217; etc etc. And so (jumping back on a hobby horse) we return to the idea of &#8216;movement&#8217; as a <span style="font-style: italic">moving</span> of social relations, not a thing, but a process – and a process that has no end. One of the great pieces of graffiti from France is &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what I want but I know how to get it&#8217;. Apart from being punk as fuck, it&#8217;s also a great take on &#8216;many yeses, one no&#8217; and &#8216;walking we ask questions&#8217;.</p>
<p>Of course part of that moving (walking?) will involve setting limits, defining ourselves etc. In D&amp;G terms these are moments of territorialisation. These are inevitable and can be really productive. They can be pretty big &amp; therefore more &#8216;permanent&#8217; (setting up a social centre) or small &amp; more &#8216;negotiable&#8217; (eg a social centre refusing to become an &#8217;employer&#8217;). In Paris, for example, that process of definition would enable people to defend themselves against CRS attack or those anti-social elements that the the press have seized upon – literally creating safe spaces. Or here in Leeds, setting up a social centre has involved real moments of constraint (jumping through bureaucratic and legal hoops, never mind integrating ourselves into the money economy). But it shouldn&#8217;t stop there. As soon as we draw lines in the sand they should immediately become outdated, irrelevant or obstructive. Or to put it another way, these moments of constraint are themselves productive, creating the space for us to push through them and move on again (de-territorialisation).</p>
<p>This is the &#8216;rhythm of the multitude&#8217; (© DJ Milburn), an alternating process of contraction and expansion that&#8217;s going on all the time. Or a (non-dialectical) pulsing. We set limits but then immediately try to overcome them. The danger is that we get stuck within those definitions and stop moving. Some people from the 1 in 12 were at the meeting and they talked about how the 1 in 12 has got stuck in a very fixed identity, and is inward-looking and energy-sapping (I&#8217;m paraphrasing here). I suspect this is a common social centre problem: the building gets established and then builds its own momentum, becoming something to be defended at all costs. The CP seems to be still on an upward/outward move, but already you can see the first traces of institutionalised thinking: &#8216;We must have a cafe&#8217;, &#8216;We must have gigs&#8217;, &#8216;We must open during the week&#8217; instead of asking &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic">Why?</span>&#8216;</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I&#8217;ll end on an upbeat note. This is from a blog from Montpellier (emphasis added). It speaks loads about what the <span style="font-style: italic">moving</span> of social relations can mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>The road to the station is blocked by a line of CRS police vans, in front of which is a small pro-CPE demo of about 10 – 15 people, in front of them there&#8217;s a line of CRS on foot, and in front of them a double line of demonstration stewards preventing a confrontation. Most of the demonstrators are not up for a confrontation, but some chuck eggs, cans, fairly light things at the pro-CPE demo. The stewards, who are mainly students, are urging demonstrators to continue quickly past – they&#8217;re really enthusiastic about giving orders. Someone ironically shouts &#8221;Be submissive! Do as you&#8217;re told!&#8221; One of the stewards I know personally &#8211; he&#8217;s the son of anarchist friends: I shout angrily at him, &#8221;Have you got no shame? How can you protect your enemies?&#8221; He looks upset. Lycee and technical college students hold a sit-down meeting in the big square in the centre of town, lots of different youths getting up to speak, though nothing beyond youth precarity is talked about. A cry goes out – &#8221;To the station!&#8221;, echoed by a 16 year old girl from my village, who says she wants to occupy the railway tracks. Having given her a few English lessons a year or so before, I had no idea she was rebellious. <span style="font-style: italic">Funny how you don&#8217;t know people until there&#8217;s a situation like this – and perhaps people don&#8217;t really begin to know themselves until there&#8217;s a situation like this</span> …People return to the main square, where already people are drifting off towards the Corum Theatre in order to occupy it. Some think the call to go to the station was a manipulation so as to have time for the cops to get to the Corum … I see the guy I knew who&#8217;d been a demo steward protecting the pro-CPE demonstrators three hours earlier, the son of anarchist friends, and he waves me over, saying, &#8221;What I did earlier back there was stupid, really stupid, but I was the first to get truncheoned by the cops here, trying to get into the Corum&#8221;. <span style="font-style: italic">If I was religious, I&#8217;d call it &#8216;redemption&#8217;, but let&#8217;s just call it &#8216;radicalisation&#8217;: sometimes radicalisation only takes a few hours.</span></p></blockquote>

                            		              		<p>These are a couple of random thoughts that have been buzzing around my head. Part of this is the idea to maybe finish the <span style="font-style: italic">Event Horizon</span> trilogy – <span style="font-style: italic">Event Horizon</span> is the pre-event attempt to set a mood, <span style="font-style: italic">On The Road</span> is an analysis of how things turned out and this new piece tries to look at how we live after the event. This is tied up with the role of social centres, but tackles wider themes. Maybe we could aim to get it out for the <span style="font-style: italic">consulta</span>?</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing that started me off was Vernon God Little&#8217;s refrain of &#8220;what kind of fucken life is this?&#8221; In the book it&#8217;s almost wholly negative, but we can split this up two ways: 1) What sort of life do we <span style="font-style: italic">want</span>? 2) How do we live <span style="font-style: italic">this</span> life? They&#8217;re intimately related of course: how do we live this life in terms of survival <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> how do we live it in terms of the life we desire? Or to recycle a recent book, how can we take those worlds we glimpsed at Gleneagles and generalise them so that they make sense in the rest of our lives?</p>
<p>In the run-up to big events (like Gleneagles) there&#8217;s a real rush of energy, a coming-together. Obviously that&#8217;s all gone after the event, and too often we see recrimination and a general coming-apart. But it&#8217;s not simply how we cope with the come-down. It&#8217;s more how we do live this life and still retain all that stuff we&#8217;ve gained at the Hori-Zone for example? After the high point of <span style="font-style: italic">Autonomia</span> in Italy, thousands turned to drugs or cracked up, not just because of State repression but because the forms of life they had been living were no longer sustainable. The (expansive) experiments seemed to have broken down irrevocably. More, the collective body had been decomposed, so attempts to live this life reverted to the level of the individual where contradictions were, for many, too intense to handle.</p>
<p>This sounds like I&#8217;m suggesting a survival guide, and I guess I am, but by <span style="font-style: italic">survival</span> I don&#8217;t mean settling for <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> than life. Life and living now seem to be at the heart of political struggle. We&#8217;re constantly creating <span style="font-style: italic">multiple</span> forms of life, zooming off in different trajectories, in the same way that we don&#8217;t each produce a single subjectivity, but collectively produce and re-produce multiple ones, often in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>Something else I&#8217;ve been thinking about is the entreprenurial spirit. Before you reach for your guns, hear me out. What set me off was the final programme in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/lefties3.shtml"><span style="font-style: italic">Lefties</span></a> series which looked at the rise and fall of <span style="font-style: italic">News on Sunday</span>, a spectacularly failed attempt to have a &#8216;far left&#8217; national Sunday tabloid (with a lot of the drive coming from ex-Big Flame members). They raised over £6m and one of them commented that they smashed the idea that the Left had to be poverty-stricken &#8211; they proved they were the real <span style="font-style: italic">entrepreneurs</span>. Obviously it&#8217;s a very loaded term but it&#8217;d be great to reclaim it. We produce wealth; and there&#8217;s nothing more &#8216;entreprenuerial&#8217; than starting a band with your mates. The problem is that we  find it hard to sustain this without it being expressed as <span style="font-style: italic">money</span>, channelled into capital&#8217;s circuits. Again we can learn from Italy and the explosion of small businesses after the collapse of <span style="font-style: italic">Autonomia</span>: <a href="http://www.generation-online.org/c/cmassentrepreneurship.htm">http://www.generation-online.org/c/cmassentrepreneurship.htm</a></p>
<p>Of course this brings in the whole issue of &#8216;compromise&#8217;, and the lines we can and can&#8217;t cross. We keep stumbling across these issues at the CommonPlace in Leeds. Can we have rented social centres? Can we allow money-making events? We frown on &#8216;profit-making&#8217; entreprises, but making money for charities is apparently OK (including charities who have paid workers?), as is making money to pay our landlord. What about CCTV on door? The balance of &#8216;political&#8217; vs &#8216;social&#8217; events?</p>
<p>And all that brings us back round to how we live this life. Look, I didn&#8217;t promise this post would offer any way out&#8230;<br />

                            		              		<p>The reason that &#8216;Lefties&#8217; appealed to me (apart from the obvious nostalgia) was that it made me think about the question of how we do politics in the absence of events like Gleneagles or Evian. What is &#8216;politics&#8217;? What is &#8216;do&#8217;? I re-read our <a href="http://www.nadir.org.uk/whatismovement.html">piece</a> for Derive Approdi and it suggested loads of avenues for us to wander down. I also remember reading on the back of some book about &#8220;how can we take those worlds we glimpse in such moments and generalise them so that they make sense in the rest of our lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of seeing Big Events as separate from the rest of our lives. But in a way they <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> separate: part of the dream-like unreality of GE was that I was cut loose from my normal day-to-day life (home, kids, work). I (we) could really act fast and be open to all possibilities because we were stripped bare (insert Carry On joke here). That&#8217;s why summits have the potential they have: we can be catapulted into a different way of being far quicker than would be possible if we had to take all our &#8216;baggage&#8217; with us. But it&#8217;s also why the high wears off: because (all other things being equal) it&#8217;s unsustainable in the face of &#8216;normality&#8217;. So how do we make it sustainable? Do we even want to? &#8216;Lefties&#8217; made me think about things the other way round: not how to prepare for summits (as we did in Event Horizon) but how to normalise summit politics, so that GE comes home with us. Does this make sense? For all the talk of not being absolute or &#8216;having a line&#8217;, it&#8217;s actually possible to go to places like GE with a &#8216;line&#8217; and stick to it. But it&#8217;s obviously much harder to have a strict line when we&#8217;ve crashed back down to earth: no-one&#8217;s been able to really sustain the argument against rented social centres, for example. That&#8217;s why the 1970s squat scene or punk (score!) were in a different league to the alter-globalisation movement/social centre scene: they appeared to be sustainable if only for a few months/years (or until whichever moment of punk betrayal is your favourite). Dole culture obviously had a lot to do with it, and that&#8217;s a space that&#8217;s diminished enormously: but the fact that most of us have got &#8216;jobs&#8217; must also reduce the space for purism.</p>
<p>The whole question of &#8216;negotiation&#8217;/&#8217;compromise&#8217; (or whatever term you like) is worth digging into. The best (only?) political discussions at the CommonPlace often seem to circle around these themes. Maybe this is what politics is, that constant experimentation, a (random) chipping away at all that surrounds us. Not in a coherent way (like sinister Trots and transitional demands &#8211; &#8220;now we must expose the weakness of local government&#8221;), but more the way kids will absent-mindedly finger a hole in their clothes. How does this fit in with &#8216;biopolitics&#8217;? Or living a life? And if we ever wrote something on it, could we get an &#8216;I walk the line&#8217; reference into it?</p>
