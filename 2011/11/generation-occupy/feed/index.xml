The book is a history of the 1970s and 80s US group the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_a_New_Society&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;‘Movement for a New Society’&lt;/a&gt; and what gives these reflections weight is that this group probably did more than any other to spread consensus decision making practice amongst US social movements. The group dissolved itself in 1988 and one of the reasons they gave for dissolution was their inability to develop strategy within their consensus process. All this merely reinforces the experience of the counter-globalisation movement and if we are to avoid the short-circuiting of this problem with lazy reassertions of the party then we would do well to re-call some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openspaceforum.net/twiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=266&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;internal critiques&lt;/a&gt; developed within the horizontal wing of the previous movement.]]></description>
