		<description><![CDATA[Interesting reflection. I would like to point out that Reagan&#039;s &lt;i&gt;&quot;if not us, who?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is a version of the old maxim, &lt;i&gt;&quot;If not us, then who? If not now, then when?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (as referenced in the title of Primo Levi&#039;s &quot;Si non ora, quando?&quot;). Which is, itself, a paraphrase of a saying of a much older &quot;great communicator&quot;, Rabbi Hillel, in the form &lt;i&gt;&quot;If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And when I am only for myself, what am &#039;I&#039;? And if not now, when?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. Of course, perhaps that middle question is one Reagan and his neoliberal cronies were less exercised by.]]></description>
