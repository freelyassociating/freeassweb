		<description><![CDATA[Well I half followed that above and the link. And I can&#039;t say I more than half agreed with it.

Because I have a whole list of demands.

1. Not to be treated or be expected to become a biological robot. 
2. Not to be treated as a unit of production or consumption.
3. Not be expected to be dull.
4. Not be expected to take my thinking off a shelf. 
5. I&#039;m not looking for a new conformity. That seems to be the hallmark of so called alternative politics.
6. Androids are dreaming of electric sheep- let everyone have a cow or a hose.
7. Children to be taught to think not just taught to learn.
8. No more &#039;managers&#039;
9. No more being expected to become city rats.  
10.stop trying to replace the people with a more compliant people- as far as I can see capitalism and most so called socialists seem to be on the same page on that one.

I could go on.

As far as I see it- Me and my friends are the ones who live under occuption- and 99% is shit. Campaign to be better treated slaves- but it better not be at mines expense. Because as far as I can see the occupy this and that campaign is a campaign of managers- not a campaign to make us free of being slaves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The silent scream is still bouncing around the inside of my head from your Hebden Hey Gathering. Sorry, but it&#039;s tricky running to the hills when you live in the hills. We don&#039;t need a world turned upside down, we need to tip the bastards off the world. Occupy is us. Climate Camp was us. There is only now and we&#039;re all in it. 

Your meetings could be your action, if you/we engage. &#039;problem is your undercover is such a nice guy.

I suggest
