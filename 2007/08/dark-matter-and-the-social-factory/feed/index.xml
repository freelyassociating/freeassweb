		<description><![CDATA[Great post. My first thought when I heard about Anthony’s bucket kick was &quot;Lets do a Tony Wilson night down the Common Place&quot;. Oh yes ever the entrepreneur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it seems pretty fitting to cash in on him and funnel that money back into political projects. The other point of doing the night would be to bring out the politics that runs through the best pop music of the last 40 years (if not before).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hit the nail on the head when you talk about Tony’s motivation being making things happen. He just wasn’t that interested in making money; either that or he was really shit at it. Making money wasn’t about increasing abstract quantities but was about funding the next interesting project. He also just didn’t care about people thinking he was a twat if that was the price to be paid for getting things moving. In any assemblage you have to work out what desire is operating here. For Tony it was the desire to stir the pot to see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the desire behind the debate at Lib Com that you link to? A totally conservative desire to shore up their position as the maintainer of pure occult knowledge. Critique may sometimes be a necessary shoring up move but it isn&#039;t the creative part of politics and without creation politics becomes pure anti-production, pure death instinct. The desire is not to get things moving but to stop them moving.]]></description>
