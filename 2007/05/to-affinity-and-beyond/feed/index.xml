		<description><![CDATA[Those quotes from Horizontalism also remind me that there’s a link in this to language. I can remember sitting in a painful meeting at the Hori-Zone on 7 July as people wrestled with the exact wording of a press release. Should we “wholeheartedly” condemn the bombings? And how to extend our “sympathy”? And who to? And how should we sign it? The problem was that by this time we were wholly on someone else’s terrain, where language was about precision, clarity and ticking the right boxes, an ‘us’ and a ‘them’ Not about changing the fucking world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a really important problematic: &lt;i&gt;how can affinity encounter difference in a productive way?&lt;/i&gt; Brian is of course right in suggesting the identities of identity politics tend to be fixed categories. In reality, we all take on multiple identities, which shift over time and depending on context. At one moment, you might be a woman, the next an educated and respected academic, say. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes books you read a long time ago stick in your memory. One of those books for me is D.H. Lawrence&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Lady Chatterley&#039;s Lover&lt;/i&gt;. One of the things that makes this novel so exciting is Lawrence&#039;s awareness of tensions and contradictions between the different &quot;identities&quot; and oppressions, here class and gender: Constance (Lady Chatterley) is an aristocratic woman, whilst her (male) lover, Oliver Mellors, is a gamekeeper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ve been reading &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.akpress.org/2006/items/horizontalism&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Horizontalism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of accounts of various aspects of the movements in Argentina and how they&#039;re grappling with so many of these issues. There&#039;s loads of interesting stuff in there -- enough for a whole post -- but a few directly relevant to this affinity vs. identity politics question. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, and this relates to the tendency amongst some people who believe in identity politics to attempt to &lt;i&gt;measure&lt;/i&gt; oppression. This from the group Colectivo Situaciones:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Some think, for example, that &lt;i&gt;horizontalidad&lt;/i&gt; [&quot;horizontalism&quot;] is the number of minutes each person speaks, or a quantity of techniques that will make all communication work. The real question of &lt;i&gt;horizontalidad&lt;/i&gt; is: What does it mean to organize ourselves?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the second quotation is from Paula, part of feminist and gay, lesbian, transvestites, transsexual and bisexual (GLTTB) collectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What is it that makes a person different from me? If I only think about difference, then I am sort of pigeon-holing them and making a separation. &lt;i&gt;Horizontalidad&lt;/i&gt; permits us to think not solely in terms of difference, but rather to live with other people and be able to have political discussions with them, without trying to define them. ... [In the GLTTB movement] it wasn&#039;t important if you were lesbian, transvestite, gay, heterosexual, or whatever. It wasn&#039;t important.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a really important problematic: <i>how can affinity encounter difference in a productive way?</i> Brian is of course right in suggesting the identities of identity politics tend to be fixed categories. In reality, we all take on multiple identities, which shift over time and depending on context. At one moment, you might be a woman, the next an educated and respected academic, say. </p>
<p>Sometimes books you read a long time ago stick in your memory. One of those books for me is D.H. Lawrence&#8217;s <i>Lady Chatterley&#8217;s Lover</i>. One of the things that makes this novel so exciting is Lawrence&#8217;s awareness of tensions and contradictions between the different &#8220;identities&#8221; and oppressions, here class and gender: Constance (Lady Chatterley) is an aristocratic woman, whilst her (male) lover, Oliver Mellors, is a gamekeeper.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a HREF="http://www.akpress.org/2006/items/horizontalism" REL="nofollow"><i>Horizontalism</i></a>, a collection of accounts of various aspects of the movements in Argentina and how they&#8217;re grappling with so many of these issues. There&#8217;s loads of interesting stuff in there &#8212; enough for a whole post &#8212; but a few directly relevant to this affinity vs. identity politics question. </p>
<p>First, and this relates to the tendency amongst some people who believe in identity politics to attempt to <i>measure</i> oppression. This from the group Colectivo Situaciones:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some think, for example, that <i>horizontalidad</i> [&#8220;horizontalism&#8221;] is the number of minutes each person speaks, or a quantity of techniques that will make all communication work. The real question of <i>horizontalidad</i> is: What does it mean to organize ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the second quotation is from Paula, part of feminist and gay, lesbian, transvestites, transsexual and bisexual (GLTTB) collectives:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that makes a person different from me? If I only think about difference, then I am sort of pigeon-holing them and making a separation. <i>Horizontalidad</i> permits us to think not solely in terms of difference, but rather to live with other people and be able to have political discussions with them, without trying to define them. &#8230; [In the GLTTB movement] it wasn&#8217;t important if you were lesbian, transvestite, gay, heterosexual, or whatever. It wasn&#8217;t important. The question was not asked, and that&#8217;s interesting &#8212; no one asked, how do you identify yourself?&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, but it’s tempting to conclude that we can put identity in one column (bad) and affinity in the other (good). I know that’s not what you’re saying but it’s an easy leap to make.&lt;br/&gt;It’s class that offers a key here (surprise, surprise). Class can be seen as a static &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, a sociological category we’re born into and from which there’s no escape (and from which we don&#039;t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to escape). That’s the openly bonkers position. Or else we can (&lt;i&gt;stroke beard&lt;/i&gt;) see it as a process, as a &lt;i&gt;becoming&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Surely it&#039;s much the same with identity. In fact maybe identity is the wrong word, or the word we should use when it has calcified, settled into a thing or category. Before that happens, there’s a whole process of becoming which is enormously productive. That’s the creative explosion we find at the birth of Black Power, or the second wave of feminism, or Queer Liberation or whatever. There’s an emphasis on changing ourselves as much as the world (as if it could be any other way!).&lt;br/&gt;That minoritarian thrust doesn’t last, and when it settles down, it’s ripe for enclosure and commodification. Hence the huge amounts of local government money poured into Racism Awareness Training courses etc in the 1980s. Blimey, I&#039;m coming over all &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; here, so I&#039;d better stop. But there is more to be discussed here, especially around affinity and the way it works...]]></description>
