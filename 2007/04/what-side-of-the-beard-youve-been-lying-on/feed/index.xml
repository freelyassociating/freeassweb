		<description><![CDATA[Well, actually I was thinking of something much more ambitious than Timotei. Not just Zounds flogging Vodafone or Intel (ah, so that’s where we heard those Mockney tones first), but national exhibitions of artwork for Flux of Pink Indians, and Lloyd Webber doing &lt;i&gt;Christ The Musical&lt;/i&gt; in the West End. I give it five years...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, I am intrigued by this idea of plunder, how we can (or could) take something from the past and make the present into something else. Twist it. Fuck up time. I came across this great speech by Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, which seems to speak to some of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A lot of us running around talking about politics don&#039;t even know what politics is. Did you ever see something and pull it and you take it as far as you can and it almost outstretches itself and it goes into something else? If you take it so far that it is two things? As a matter of fact, some things if you stretch it so far, it’ll be another thing. Did you ever cook something so long that it turns into something else? Ain’t that right?&lt;br/&gt;That&#039;s what we’re talking about with politics.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you put it like that, &lt;i&gt;politics&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t seem such a hateful notion.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, actually I was thinking of something much more ambitious than Timotei.

<p>Anyway, I am intrigued by this idea of plunder, how we can (or could) take something from the past and make the present into something else. Twist it. Fuck up time. I came across this great speech by Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, which seems to speak to some of this.<br /><i>“A lot of us running around talking about politics don&#8217;t even know what politics is. Did you ever see something and pull it and you take it as far as you can and it almost outstretches itself and it goes into something else? If you take it so far that it is two things?

<p>When you put it like that, <i>politics</i> doesn’t seem such a hateful notion.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post, well put. You might be right about Crass being ripe for a re-packaging, but weren’t they ripe a few years ago? I think it’s been tried and found wanting. There’s a more serious point though about our ability to plunder the past. Punk re-worked so much of hippy&#039;s original attitude (without of course acknowledging it), which is how it made sense to a wider audience than itself (the more turned-on hippies were among the first to get it, just as the more turned-on punks were among the first to get rave etc etc). But that sort of re-appropriation just doesn&#039;t seem possible any more. Think of an era, a song, an &lt;i&gt;attitude&lt;/i&gt;, and you can bet some suit from an ad agency will have got there first. This also leads on to stuff about irony, detachment and cynicism as a post-modern survival strategy. It’s liberating in its own way, but it means we can&#039;t simply use tactics from an earlier game. But enough of these generalities, I’m getting back to growing my beard.]]></description>
